This report investigates a dataset of 100k medical appointments in Brazil: [no-show-appointment](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd2e9a_noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016/noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv). 
The dataset is focused on the question of whether patients show up to their appointments according to different factors. Some of the factors to take into account:

- 'ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
- ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
- ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
- several symptoms like: 'Hypertension', 'Diabetes', 'alcoholism' and 'handicap'
- 'Sms-received': whether the patient received an sms of the appointment or not.

The report aims firstly to investigate the Brazilian health care system and to find a number of factors that can lead to the patient not showing for an appointment. For that, the questions to be answered are as follows:

- What factors are important for knowing if a patient will show up to an appointment or not?
- How is the problem (not showing for appointments) distributed accross the locations in Brazil?
- How is the problem distributed across age and gender of patients?
