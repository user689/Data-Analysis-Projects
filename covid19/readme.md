In this report we explore some trends in the Covid-19 dataset.

Data was collected from different sources. My main source to search for data was: https://www.kaggle.com

Datasets included:
- Covid Containment Dataset: The dataset was collected from http://epidemicforecasting.org/containment.
- Covid-19 Dataset: Collected from the World Helth Organisation. 
- Country population and other data: Collected from a kaggle dataset. Only specific columns like population and median age are useful to compare countries.
- Data Specific to Country (Lebanon): Since I am from Lebanon, I am interested in how this country compares to other countries. Most of the required data is available in the 2nd database. However, additional data was obtained manually from local and government websites.
