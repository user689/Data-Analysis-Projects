In this project, we analyze data obtained from a twitter account called 'WerateDogs' which rates dogs on a scale of 10 (usually in a very absurd way).

Data comes from 3 sources:

- twitter_archive_enhanced.csv a file obtained from the twitter archive of the WeRateDogs account. The file can be obtained [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/59a4e958_twitter-archive-enhanced/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv)
- image_predictions.tsv a file containing image predictions. The file was downloaded using download_predictions.py file.
- tweet_json.json a file obtained using the twitter API. Check the file: `twitter_api.py`


Main reports:

- wrangle_act: The main wrangling and visualization report
- wrangle_report: a report summarizing wrangling and cleaning efforts on the dataset
- act_report: a quick report showing the main results and visulizations
